This is a powerful tool for reducing your taxable income.\n\n**Deduction Limit / Tax Rate:** The maximum deduction allowed under Section 80C is \u20b91,50,000 per financial year. There's no tax rate associated with 80C itself; it simply reduces your taxable income, leading to lower tax liability.\n\n**Qualifying Investments / Items:**  Many popular investment options qualify for deduction under Section 80C. These include:\n\n*   Life Insurance Premiums (for self, spouse, children, or parents)\n*   Employee's contribution to Provident Fund (PF) or Voluntary Provident Fund (VPF)\n*   Public Provident Fund (PPF) contributions\n*   National Savings Certificates (NSC) investments\n*   5-Year Fixed Deposits with Banks (specified tax-saving FDs)\n*   Senior Citizen Savings Scheme (SCSS) investments\n*   Sukanya Samriddhi Account (SSY) contributions for a girl child\n*   Tax-saving Fixed Deposits (with a lock-in period of 5 years)\n*   Unit Linked Insurance Plans (ULIPs) - only the premiums paid, not the investment component.\n*   Tuition fees paid for children's education (subject to certain limits)\n*   National Pension Scheme (NPS) contributions (additional \u20b950,000 limit under Section 80CCD)\n*   Post Office Time Deposits (with a minimum 5-year tenure)\n\n\n**Exclusions:** Several items do *not* qualify for deduction under Section 80C.

You need to provide proof of your investments and contributions.\n\n\n**Additional Points:**\n\n*   Section 80C deductions cannot be claimed for contributions from undisclosed sources.\n*   The primary goal of Section 80C is to encourage long-term savings and investments in government-approved schemes.\n*   Remember to factor in the overall limit of \u20b91,50,000. If your total eligible investments exceed this amount, you can only claim a deduction up to this limit.\n\n\n**Disclaimer:** This is an AI-generated answer, not tax or legal advice.
